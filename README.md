# AutoSpoto
Auto Playlist creator according the user average running pace

As a long distance runner(amateur), I know how much the music contributes to my performance.
Every time, I tried to create energetic playlist with my favourite songs, I found it is much slower then my running tempo.

So, when I found out that SPOTIFY is so friendly for data mining and includes the Audio Features about the tempo, I used my free time (I don't have a lot- First year of CS degree) to create the first step of this automation 
and it is already very useful ! Be aware I plan to keep developing this idea in the Summer.
